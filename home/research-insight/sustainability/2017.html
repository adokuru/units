    <p><em><strong>Impact by Design 2017</strong></em> is Gensler’s second annual publication analyzing the sustainable performance of our work. In it, we provide a comprehensive look at the energy performance and the carbon impact of our design work, a broad analysis of how new innovations in design, engineering, and technology are improving the sustainable footprint of the global built environment, and recently completed projects that exemplify sustainable design in action, while noting specific strategies or design aspects that have made noticeable differences.</p>

Shanghai, China
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The computational design process used to create the Shanghai Tower is what allowed for the building’s complex, energy-efficient form. Its twisting form uses 25 percent less steel than a comparable tower with a rectangular base, and demonstrates the potential that high powered design technologies hold for the future..&lt;br&gt;
